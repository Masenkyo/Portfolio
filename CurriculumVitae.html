    I learned this work isn’t easy when I was 14 since I had to work more than 20 hours a week and I didn’t really like that. 
    <br>
    And currently I’ve applied for a new job at Vomar and I know some people there and this time I am 17.

    We sometimes need to work on our skills like C# etc. but sometimes we also work on making games and working with game artists, this also is a good experience for teamwork.
